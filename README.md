# ROAD TO WEB3

Hey Guys ! So this repo is for me to kickoff my web3 developer journey ! I will be following [Alchemy University's road to web3](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/welcome-to-the-road-to-web3) path, which is a 10 week (1 project / week) self paced web3 developer program to help new blockchain devs go from beginner to advanced.

Each folder in this repo represents a project from this series and I will explain what has been done in each one of these projects.

Although I'm an experience web2 dev, there are so much more things to learn in web3 and blockchain, the journey is long but super fun ! 

If you want to follow my journey be sure to follow me on [twitter](twitter.com/nonfungibleluc) where I am the most active !


# The 10 Projects

## Week 1: How to Develop an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721) with Alchemy

The things covered in this week's lesson is how to simply develop an NFT Smart contract with the help of Alchemy, OpenZeppelin, Remix and Ethereum Goerli More precisely what I learned was:

-   How to write and modify the smart contract using OpenZeppelin and Remix
-   Get free Goerli ETH using  **[https://goerlifaucet.com/](https://goerlifaucet.com/)**
-   Deploy it on the Ethereum Goerli testnet blockchain to save on gas fees
-   Host the NFT tokens metadata on IPFS using Filebase.
-   Mint an NFT and visualize it on OpenSea.

I really recommend you follow the full step by step tutorial by clicking on this [link](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-develop-an-nft-smart-contract-erc721-with-alchemy)

## Week 2: Build a"Buy Me a Coffee" DeFi dapp

This projects get's a bit more hands on, where you have to configure your Visual Studio Code IDE, install Hardhat start developing and deploying contracts from your terminal instead of using Remix or some extra tools. I built a simple smart contract that can collect donations from others.

What I specifically did was:
-   Use the  **Hardhat**  development environment to build, test, and deploy our  smart contract.
-   Connect your MetaMask wallet to the  **Goerli**  test network using an  **Alchemy**  RPC endpoint.
-   Get free  **Goerli**  ETH from  **goerlifaucet.com.**
-   Use  **Ethers.js**  to interact with your deployed smart contract.
-   Build a frontend website for your decentralized application with  **Replit**.

> Note: in my folder you will find the full smart contract and JS code, the front end was pre written in a tool specified in the tutorial so if you want to test out the full functionality with the UI I recommend you follow the tutorial [here](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-build-buy-me-a-coffee-defi-dapp)

*Please note that if you find some differences in the code this is normal, each lesson has a challenge at the end and I try to implement every challenge. I will continue updating this read me as I go through each weeks project.*
